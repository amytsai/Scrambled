Scrambled
=========
Scrambled is a small JavaScript project I created to practice string manipulations in JavaScript. It takes an input string of text, and scrambles all of the letters in each word except the first and last letter. Right now, the code correctly handles normal English text with quotes, commas and periods. There is not yet support for line-breaks.
